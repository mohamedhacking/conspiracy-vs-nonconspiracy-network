Social Network Analysis (SNA) – WICO Dataset

A complete Social Network Analysis project comparing Conspiracy vs Non-Conspiracy Twitter subgraphs using the WICO Dataset and Gephi.

This repository includes:
✔ Two graph directories (Conspiracy & Non-Conspiracy)
✔ Full visual network analysis
✔ Gephi statistics reports
✔ A professional comparative report
✔ Node/edge datasets
✔ Research-focused security insights (fake followers, bot patterns, network manipulation)

🧠 Project Summary

This project performs a comparative analysis between two Twitter communities:

🔴 Conspiracy Network

Dense small cluster

Central core node

Redundant message paths

Indicates potential echo chamber behavior

🔵 Non-Conspiracy Network

Perfect star/broadcast structure

One central super-hub

Many isolated leaf nodes

Behavior resembles fake followers or automated amplification accounts

📊 Gephi Analysis Included

Graph Density

Average Degree

Modularity

Strong/Weak Connected Components

Diameter & Path Length

Clustering Coefficient

Betweenness & Closeness Centrality

🔐 Security & Misinformation Insights

The project highlights patterns related to:

Echo chambers

Coordinated activity

Fake followers

Bot networks

Centralized broadcast manipulation

Network fragility vs resilience

🛠 Tools Used
